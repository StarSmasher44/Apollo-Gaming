changes: 
  - tweak: "Surgery now produces normal wounds instead of snowflake 'open incisions'. Do not be alarmed, do not bandage those if you plan to continue surgery, clamp. If incision was made with scalpel, you'll be able to cauterize it, healing a lot of damage."
  - tweak: "Skull/ribs surgery changed, now you just need to use the saw to crack em. Fractures count as being open too. Retractor steps for ribs etc are gone, use normal bone repair surgery aferwards."
  - tweak: "Coincidently you can just rip them apart with cut wounds to get access to innard surgery steps. It takes much more damage than surgical incisions though."
  - tweak: "Bones now fracture when damage is taken rather than from existing damage. Meaning if you fix bones, they won't refracture immediately without taking damage."
  - tweak: "You don't need to crack open the bones to get shrapnel now. If you can see it on examine, you can take it out with just a retracted incision."
  - rscadd: "Added new surgery step - disinfecting wounds. You can use sterilizine or high proof booze, in spraybottles/droppers/bottles/glasses/buckets. Works same as ointment."
